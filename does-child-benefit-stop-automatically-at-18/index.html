<p>A young person must be accepted onto an approved course or training before their 19th birthday to be eligible. Child tax credit is also being phased out, unless your child turns 18 or. The tax credit will not affect the child benefit you receive. .</p>
<h3 id="does-child-benefit-automatically-stop-at-18">Does Child Benefit Automatically Stop At 18?</h3><p>Does child benefit stop automatically at 18? You need to inform hmrc that you child is not leaving approved education or your child benefit will stop. Brutal for august born, nicer for september. Child tax credit usually stops on 31 august after your child turns 16, unless they continue.</p>
<h3 id="if-your-child-continues-in-approved-education-child-benefit-will-stop">If Your Child Continues In Approved Education Child Benefit Will Stop.</h3><p>Child tax credit is also being phased out, unless your child turns 18 or. My sons dad decided that he no longer needed to support him either. That can happen either on, or soon after your child has had their 16th birthday. You can tell hmrc if your child is eligible in the following ways:</p>
<h3 id="child-benefit-usually-stops-on-31st-august-following-a-child039s-18th-birthday">Child Benefit Usually Stops On 31St August Following A Child�s 18Th Birthday.</h3><p>By post to child tax credits, tax credits office, preston, pr1 4at, and to child benefit office, po box 1, newcastle upon tyne, ne88 1aa. Yeah it�s always the august after their 18th. To get the child benefit extension your child must not be working more than 23 hours a week and you must apply within three months of them leaving education or training. Have child benefit or child tax credits ove tax credit stopped because you have a child who has turned 16?</p>
<h3 id="child-benefit-will-stop-if-they-leave-education-or-end-their-training">Child Benefit Will Stop If They Leave Education Or End Their Training.</h3><p>Child benefit stops when the extension period ends or when your child turns 18, whichever comes first. I�m a bit confused as i presumed once your teen hit their 18th birthday their child benefit stopped even if they were in their 2nd year of sixth form/college. If your child stays in ‘approved’ education child benefit can continue to be paid. Yes, it all stops in the august.</p>
