<p>It could be the sign of an uncommon sensitivity or condition that makes being touched uncomfortable for the baby, and it could also be allergies or other skin conditions as well. While having a baby sleep on mother’s (or father’s) chest whilst parents are awake has not been shown to be a risk, and such close contact is in fact beneficial, sleeping a baby on their front when unsupervised gives rise to a greatly increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (sids) also known as cot death. A lot depends on your baby�s age. Michaele Boncaro Photography Blog.</p>

<p>As with any milestone, feel confident that your baby will get there in their own time and don’t worry too much about. Bear in mind that it�s best for your baby to sleep in the same room as you for his first six months. She often simply wakes up and starts to coo and gurgle or make loud noises.
