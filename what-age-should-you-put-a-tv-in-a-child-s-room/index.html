<p>I think it depends on the age of the child as far as tvs in their rooms go. I have 4 children, ages 4, 20 months, and 10 month twins. In conclusion that is why kids should not have tvs in. It’s nice to give bobby the nintendo paradise he’s always wanted in his room, but chances are that 19″ lcd will see it’s demise at the hands of a game of wii bowling.</p>
