The safest place for a baby to sleep for the first six months is in a crib or cot in a room with its parents. I think its supposed to be at 6 months, as this is when the dangers of cot death are reduced,but if your lo is too big for the moses basket, maybe you could put him in his cot, but make sure that it is in your room, so you can still check him easily &amp; hear for any breathing difficulties etc. Use a monitor so you can. Always tuck your baby in with blankets across their chest and under their arms public health scotland.
