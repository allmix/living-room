Since everything goes with white, this is the best color for a dining table to match your dark wood floor. Light furniture upholstery and frame materials work wonderfully with dark wooden floors. Keep the overall effect elegant and light by balancing the dark floors with white cabinetry and walls, warm bronze metals and wood accents just a few shades lighter than the floors. If you are choosing to match furniture to the floors, go with a lighter colour on the walls.
