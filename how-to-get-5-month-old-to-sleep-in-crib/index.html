Sleep Training Tips for 5 Month Old Babies From babysleepmadesimple.com
For babies less than 4 months and those not rolling, you want to swaddle for naps and bedtime to help decrease the startle reflex. Use nightlights or low wattage bulbs to see when you’re checking on your baby or changing. That includes about 10 to 11 hours of solid nighttime snoozing (though he might still wake up a few times) and three naps that last 30 minutes to two hours each. Your baby will get the most out of daytime naps if he or she takes them at the same time each day and for about the same length of time.
