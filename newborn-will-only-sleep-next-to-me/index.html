<h3 id="but-dads-im-talking-to-you-here">But Dads, I’m Talking To You Here:</h3><p>Stay with him and rock him, sing, or stroke his face or hand until he settles down. Once your baby is no longer newborn, but still napping on you, chances are it’s become a habit they’re more. Babies need and seek physical contact to feel calm and protected, just like when they were in the womb. Assuming it’s mom who is holding the baby, your baby did sleep with your heartbeat sound for many months.</p>
<h3 id="thats-perfectly-fine-too-and-there-is-plenty-that-you-can-do-to-gently-break-the-habit">That’s Perfectly Fine Too, And There Is Plenty That You Can Do To Gently Break The Habit.</h3><p>It may not be a miracle solution but could help.

I’ve tried swaddling, he likes his arms free. I cry all the time imagining what i would do if i lost her. So, consider using a white noise machine with a heartbeat sound.</p>

One reason your baby may like to sleep on your chest is because of the sound of your heartbeat. Hearing your baby shriek in your arms—especially when she doesn’t do the same with mom—can feel disheartening to any dad. My husband watched us nap and he said i do not move at all.</p>
