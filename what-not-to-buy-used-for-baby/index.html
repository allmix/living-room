15 Things I Regret Not Buying for My First Baby Very Anxious Mommy From veryanxiousmommy.com
You should buy used baby shoes, clothing, hats, toys, playpens, furniture, strollers, high chairs, and car seats. Babies grow out of these faster than you can say rubber ducky, so you should be able to save money on one that was barely used. If the stroller was manufactured after the fall of 2015, then it is safe to use today. Hard items that can’t be washed, like books or wooden highchairs, can be wiped down with a disinfectant cloth and left to air dry.
